## Getting Started

To start using this Email Automation program you will need Python and the libraries used in this project installed on your computer. Next, to extract emails, you must add a list of proxies (Google will block your IP address because there will be too many requests if you use your own IP), which you can get at https://free-proxy-list.net/. Then, validate them using "proxy_checker.py", add to the "valid_proxies.txt" and change the values to what you want to search, location, etc. 
With the "email_auto_sender.py", you just have to add the body of the email, the subject, your email and password (which you can get at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords), also the attachment if you want.

## Usage

It is very useful when it comes to do the marketing of a company.
